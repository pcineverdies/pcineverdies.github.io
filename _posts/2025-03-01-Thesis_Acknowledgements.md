I am not sure if I will put the acknowledgements in my Master's thesis. 
However, I already wrote them, and I am pretty much proud of them. 
I wanted something chaotic, and I got something chaotic. 
Here they are:

    To all the special people with whom I have laughed. <br>
    To the songs that made me smile. <br>
    To the hours I spent running. <br>
    And to all the ma<b class="red">g</b>ic within our future. <br>

The c<b class="red">h</b>erry trees were still in blo<b class="red">o</b>m when I left purity. 
Thankfully, the portrait reminded me of the time we were all blind. 
I don’t remember how many time<b class="red">s</b> I lied to you, bu<b class="red">t</b> I still recall your father shouting before bedtime. 
And then, year<b class="red">s</b> of iced lemonade did little to heal their broken hearts. 
It snowe<b class="red">d</b> in August and we sunbathed in December - which s<b class="red">o</b>ng were you singing?

However, yesterday my shoe got broken; 
there is a bargai<b class="red">n</b> in the valley, I can get three shoes for the price of two, but I <b class="red">o</b>nly have two feet, 
twenty-three teeth, and four more days to spend in my home<b class="red">t</b>own. 
The prie<b class="red">s</b>t was kind, albeit a bit talkative, and I suspe<b class="red">c</b>t he went to the inn <b class="red">a</b>fter her shift. 
She probably wouldn’t like ginge<b class="red">r</b> beer, but that’s a matter of tast<b class="red">e</b>.

Imagine a life with a different eye color. 
How <b class="red">m</b>uch would it change? 
How difficult would it b<b class="red">e</b> to walk one yard without falling? 
I don’t like pl<b class="red">a</b>ying the accordio<b class="red">n</b>, so I am glad I am not short. 
I ride m<b class="red">y</b> horse on the right side, so I a<b class="red">m</b> not German, but I bet it would be easy to learn how t<b class="red">o</b> knit. 
And if Eurydice turns around, do not blame he<b class="red">r</b> - God works in predictabl<b class="red">e</b> ways.
