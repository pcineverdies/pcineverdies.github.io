    To all the special people with whom I have laughed. <br>
    To the songs that made me smile. <br>
    To the hours I spent running. <br>
    And to all the magic within our future. <br>

The cherry trees were still in bloom when I left my tank. 
Thankfully, the window worked as an amplifier for the colors. 
I don’t remember how many times I lied to you, but I still remember your father shouting at your brother. 
And then, years of iced lemonade did not help to heal their knees. 
It snowed in August and we had a sunbath in December - 
which song were we listening to?

However, yesterday, my shoe got broken; 
there is a bargain online, I can get three shoes for the price of two, but I only have two feet, twenty-three teeth and four more days to spend in my hometown. 
The clerk was kind, just a bit talkative, and I guess he went to the gym after work. 
He probably would not like strudel, but that is a matter of taste. 
Spicy meals are always tough to digest.

Imagine a life with a different eye color. 
How much would it change? 
How difficult would it be to walk 3 km without falling? 
I don’t like playing basketball, so I am glad I am not short. 
I am forced to drive on the right side so I am not British, but I bet it should be simple to learn how to knit. 
And if Eurydice turns around, do not blame her - 
math homework is not as fun as gardening.
