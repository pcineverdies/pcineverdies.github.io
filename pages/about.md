I'm Giacomo, I was born in January 2000, I enjoy **running**, **studying**, **foreign languages** and **ice cream**.

I am into low-level stuff: **digital design and verification**, **CPU architecture**, **computer architecture** and **compilers**.
I follow a _learning by doing_ approach, so I enjoy building my own projects to prove myself that I actually mastered a concept.
While this can look like _re-inventing the wheel_, I think this is the most rewarding method in the long run.
